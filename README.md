# mlops-poc-devops-showcase

This project is a hands-on MLOps learning and showcase repository.

The goal is to:
- Train a small machine learning model (not a large language model)
- Save the trained model as a versioned artifact
- Serve the model through a simple API for predictions
- Gradually add DevOps/MLOps practices such as CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring

This project focuses on understanding the machine learning lifecycle from a DevOps perspective:
training → model artifact → serving → automation.

The emphasis is on operationalizing models, not on complex ML algorithms or LLM-based chatbots.
